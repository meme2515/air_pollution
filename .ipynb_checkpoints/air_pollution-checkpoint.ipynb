    "# China and Air Pollution in the Korean Peninsula\n",
    "### Personal Project by Damien Kwon\n",
    "<p>In recent years, the South Korean public has grown notably more sensitive to the country's volatile air quality as a result of the media's attention to PM2.5 or atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, prolonged exposure to particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter can lead to premature death, nonfatal heart attacks, decreased lung function, and many other adverse health effects. The graph below depicts global estimates of PM2.5 from 2001-2006.</p>\n",

    "<p>Take note of the heavy concentration in Eastern China and the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. The national media and the government of South Korea have blamed manufacturing activity in China for the seemingly increased concentration of air pollutants in South Korea. The accusation, which has grown politically charged over the years, is based on the fact that most Chinese manufacturing plants are located in Eastern China and that winds in East Asia typically blow towards southeast during cold seasons. The following image is a map of average wind directions over East Asia during winter (November-Febrauary, 2009-2013).</p>\n",
    "<p><img src=\"img/Average-wind-directions-05x05-at-850-hPa-over-East-Asia-during-the-cold-season.png\" style=\"width:600px\"> </p>\n",
    "<p>The Chinese government, on the other hand, has a different opinion. They claim that while it may be true that some of the pollutants from mainland China may be carried over to the Korean Peninsula, a more significant source of the problem lies in the heavily industrial environment of South Korea. Indeed, diesel fuel and coal plants remain main sources of energy in the country today. Although what's most important is for both countries to reduce their respective pollutant emission levels in the future, I was personally intrigued by the subject and was curious to know whether or not China was indeed responsible for a large part of the air pollution crisis in the Koreas. Below is my analysis of the relevant data.</p>"

However, one was able to observe a significant relationship between the air quality of Seoul and Shanghai, and also dismiss certain misinformed claims such as the rising level of PM2.5 concentration in East Asia or the effect of the increasing manufacturing industry in China. More robust research is needed before making further conclusions, but it is important to remind ourselves that objectivity is key for the benefit of both countries in all circumstances.</p>"
