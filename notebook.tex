    \section{China and Air Pollution in the Korean
Peninsula}\label{china-and-air-pollution-in-the-korean-peninsula}

\subsubsection{Personal Project by Damien
Kwon}\label{personal-project-by-damien-kwon}

In recent years, the South Korean public has grown notably more
sensitive to the country's volatile air quality as a result of the
media's attention to PM2.5 or atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that
have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. According to the US
Environmental Protection Agency, prolonged exposure to particulate
matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter can lead to premature death,
nonfatal heart attacks, decreased lung function, and many other adverse
health effects. The graph below depicts global estimates of PM2.5 from
2001-2006.

Take note of the heavy concentration in Eastern China and the western
coast of the Korean Peninsula. The national media and the government of
South Korea have blamed manufacturing activity in China for the
seemingly increased concentration of air pollutants in South Korea. The
accusation, which has grown politically charged over the years, is based
on the fact that most Chinese manufacturing plants are located in
Eastern China and that winds in East Asia typically blow towards
southeast during cold seasons. The following image is a map of average
wind directions over East Asia during winter (November-Febrauary,
2009-2013).

The Chinese government, on the other hand, has a different opinion. They
claim that while it may be true that some of the pollutants from
mainland China may be carried over to the Korean Peninsula, a more
significant source of the problem lies in the heavily industrial
environment of South Korea. Indeed, diesel fuel and coal plants remain
main sources of energy in the country today. Although what's most
important is for both countries to reduce their respective pollutant
emission levels in the future, I was personally intrigued by the subject
and was curious to know whether or not China was indeed responsible for
a large part of the air pollution crisis in the Koreas. Below is my
analysis of the relevant data.

    First, I started off with an exploratory data analysis of air quality
data for Seoul for last year, provided by the country's weather
information service system. Note the peak in the PM2.5 level in January,
2019. An unusually warm winter in the Korean Peninsula trapped fine dust
in the peninsula for several days, bringing about serious health
concerns in the region. One can also observe approximately seven other
observation points above 60㎍/㎥. However, it is difficult to assess the
severity of the problem from the above data alone. Below, I've compared
average daily PM2.5 pollution levels in Seoul to that of San Francisco.

    The peak in November, 2018 for San Francisco's PM2.5 concentration level
was caused by the Camp Fire, "the deadliest and the most destructive
wildfire in California history to date". The fire broke out about 140
miles northeast of the Bay Area and is estimated to have burnt around
62,000 ha. Note how close the early 2019 Korean data was to that of San
Francisco's during the Camp Fire. As I've mentioned, the peak was only a
result of a warmer weather condition.

A brief look at the above graph makes clear that Seoul has a much poorer
air quality except for the period between August and October. The World
Health Organization guideline stipulates that average daily PM2.5 not
exceed 25ug/m3, a level atypical for the Bay Area but often exceeded in
Seoul. In fact, PM2.5 concentration level almost never went below
25ug/m3 in June, 2018. This is a source of some serious health concerns.

Now, let's explore economic data of China to try to find a relationship
between economic activity and air pollution.

    Let's explore the data on China's manufacturing industry, which have
been repeatedly accused of being responsible for the South Korean air
pollution crisis. Many manufacturing processes involve heating raw
materials to transform them into more useful forms. Oil refining, for
instance, releases sulfur dioxide into the air. Other manufacturing
types use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to
run the plant, which also release pollutants.

Above graph depicts annual manufacturing activities of both China and
South Korea. By looking at above data, it appears as though
manufacturing has become less important in the Chinese economy while the
South Koreans have come to rely on it more over the last decade.

This does not, however, mean that the absolute manufacturing activity in
China has decreased over the years. Because the measurement unit is in
percentage of GDP, it is necessary to multiply the GDP values for
respective years to derive the actual dollar output of annual
manufacturing activities.

    The graph above makes clear to us that overall manufacturing activity
has significantly increased in China, while it has remained relatively
stable in South Korea. At this point, it seems natural to hypothesize
that if Chinese manufacturing plants are indeed affecting the South
Korean air quality, this increase in manufacturing activity in USD must
have a meaningful result on Korean air pollution levels.

But such hypothesis assumes that manufacturing activity measured in USD
does indeed reflect an increase in the number of manufacturing plants
(which we lack the data for) and the resulting pollutant emissions.
After all, the question asked is whether or not PM2.5 pollution in China
is spilling over to the Koreas. One has to evaluate whether this
economic data is relevant to the question asked by comparing the
increase in manufacturing activity in USD to China's own air quality
data.

    Comparing the two data, it is difficult to observe any obvious
relationship between manufacturing activity measured in dollar output
and PM2.5 concentration level in the city of Shanghai. Manufacturing
output has increased dramatically (from roughly 2.6 trillion to 3.6
trillion) but the mean PM2.5 concentration appears to have slightly
decreased in the five year period. One can think of several explanations
to the finding.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Manufacturing is irrelevant to PM2.5 concentration.
\item
  Other factors are acting against the increase in pollutant emissions
  by the manufacturing plants.
\item
  GDP measurement does not capture the actual amount of manufacturing
  activity.
\end{enumerate}

At any rate, data does not support the South Korean government's claim
that the increasing manufacturing activities are the main source of air
pollution in the Korean Peninsula, and it seems unnecessary to compare
the Chinese manufacturing output data to that of the South Korean air
pollution. This is separate, however, from the claim that the air
pollution crisis in China is affecting the Koreas. Let's now directly
compare Shanghai's air quality to that of Seoul.

    Contrary to popular belief, neither Seoul nor Shanghai has observed an
increasing rate of air pollution in the last five years. Nonetheless,
PM2.5 level in Shanghai appear to be correlated to that of Seoul. The
PM2.5 concentration level in Seoul follows the trends shown in Shanghai,
both increasing in the winter and decreasing in the summer, but in a
much weaker intensity for Seoul. Let's try a regression analysis of the
two cities' data.

    Above is a scatter plot of monthly PM2.5 concentration levels in the two
cities between Jan 2012 and June 2017. On the left is a simple linear
regression between the two variables, with Pearson's r equal to
approximately 0.1632. This represents a meaningful, positive
relationship between the two variables given the difference in
magnitudes. On the right are one hundred, pairs bootstrap linear
regressions on Pearson's r between the two variables. Note that
Pearson's r is always positive within the 95\% confidence interval. This
is represented by the positively sloped lines drawn in purple.

It is not statistically sound to conclude from this data that China has
significant influence on the PM2.5 concentration level in the Korean
peninsula. Correlation simply tells us the strength to which one set of
data moves in the same direction as the other, and makes no statement
regarding causality. It is, however, one of many potential explanations
for the positive relationship. Other alternative explanations include
increased buring of wood and coal during colder seasons, or less overall
movement of air in lower temperatures.

The overall result of the analysis was inconclusive. There was no
definitive answer to which degree China was responsible for the air
pollution crisis in the Korean peninsula. However, one was able to
observe some degree of positive relationship between the air quality of
Seoul and Shanghai. One was also able to dismiss certain misinformed
claims, such as the rising level of PM2.5 concentration in East Asia or
the effect of the increasing manufacturing industry in China. Further
research will be necessary before making more scientific statements, but
the most important and productive thing to focus on will always be
reducing health risks for the people of both countries.
